COL Financial, one of the largest stockbrokers in the Philippines, provides fundamental and technical data to investors and traders. However, the data are separated, with discrepancies in timing and limited variables, posing challenges for users to identify potential investments and trades.

This app addresses these challenges by:
1. Aggregating fundamental and technical data from multiple sources into a single source of truth.
2. Updating the data using the most recent information, addressing timing discrepancies.
3. Creating new variables from old variables, providing additional insights.
4. Visualizing data to identify potential investments and trades, facilitating informed and timely decision-making

Please note that the app is not affiliated with COL Financial and has some limitations, such as the lack of historical and fundamental data for some stocks, as well as some data being estimated by analysts. Nonetheless, the app still provides valuable insights for investors and traders in the Philippine stock market.
